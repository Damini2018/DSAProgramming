//Two players are playing a game. The rules are as follows:
//Player 1 always moves first, and both players always play optimally.
//Initially there are A piles, where each pile has B number of stones.
//The players move in alternating turns. In each turn, a player can choose a pile of size x and reduce the number of stones to y, where 1 <= y < x, and x and y are coprime.
//If the current player is unable to make a move, they lose the game.
//Determine the winner of the game.

//Approach
//to maximize the WIN probability of himself a winner will definetly wants to reduce the pile to a number that there will be co-prime items left and simply reduce it to 1 so that the remaining number will alwasy be co-prime
// if B=1 means no player is able to make any move hence Player 1 will losse and player 2 will win
//if B>1 means players can move elements form pile.
//if odd number of piles means always Player1 will be last one who will be able to move hence wineer is Player1
//if A=even means Player2 will be last to move hence Player 2 iwll win
