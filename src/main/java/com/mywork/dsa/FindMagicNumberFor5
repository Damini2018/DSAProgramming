//Given an integer A, find and return the Ath magic number.

//A magic number is defined as a number which can be expressed as a power of 5 or sum of unique powers of 5.

//First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.
//approach 
//the solution can be seen as n in its binary representation and set bits position will tell the pow of 5
//while loop will increment the power and if the last bit is set then we need to add to the answer
