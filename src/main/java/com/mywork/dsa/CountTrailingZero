//given a number find the total count of 0 at the end in the factorial of it
//Approach
// 0 will be because of 5*2
// if A= 5 then fact(5)= 120
// 1x2x3x4x5  as count of 2 will keep on increasing as the value of A will increase but the count of 5 will not
//total #0 = Min(#2,#5)
//in our case #5 is always min hence count #5
// if A=25 #5 =1-5,1-10,1-15,1-20,2-25 so total count=6
//if A=125 then in the similar manner 3-125 
//hence to count the total 5 keep on dividing A until it is equal to 1 and add those numbers
